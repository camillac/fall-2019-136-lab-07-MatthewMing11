#Code Review For Xinyi Lin

..* tests.cpp has no tests and there are no examples to show that the program works
..* extraneous include directive for climits when there is no instance of using climits variables
..* program runs correctly but excessive use of function calls for countChar() decrease readability (possible solution is to store value into a variable)
